## UMKC CS451R - Commerce Bank Project
This project is a learning project between UMKC students and Commerce Bank for COMP-SCI 451R: Software Engineering Capstone at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

### Project Description
A web application that pulls in transaction details (we will provide sample data) and allows the user to set triggers for notification rules and receive notifications around them. The system should also save data to a database so recurring reports can be created.

Application must include:
- Login page
- Home page
- Transaction summary
- Notification rules
- Notifications based on rules
